The files in here were provided by the dotnet template and are responsible for the log-in functionality.

The folder's original path was `components/api-authorization`, but we moved it out of `components` because we don't want to have nested folders of components.

The files are largely unchanged and therefore don't follow the same conventions as the rest of the project.
